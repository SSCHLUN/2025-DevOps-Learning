To get a better grasp on Linux I have decided to dual boot between Windows 11 and Omarchy a distro of Linux. 

To start this I installed an ISO for this distro onto my flash drive from [Omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org/).

I then used Balena Etcher to put the ISO onto a flash drive and booted off of it to get to the new OS.

This is very handholdy in its process but I will be learning the major keybind over time and logging my progress here as I learn more things and run into major issues.

Working on getting more comfortable with moving between workspaces. 

Super + 1234 to move between these work spaces 

Shift + Super + 1234 to force send the current active window to specific workspace.

Trying to figure out a good work space configuration I think 3 will be for holding cheat sheets.

I am going to be installing Claude Code and VS Code to my machine to start working on developing some projects for the sake of learning. 

Claude Code has a (learn mode) where it opts in to instead prompt you to do the work yourself instead of just pasting artifacts at you to then work on your own.
