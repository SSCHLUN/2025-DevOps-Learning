To get a better grasp on Linux I have decided to dual boot between Windows 11 and Omarchy a distro of Linux. 

To start this I installed an ISO for this distro onto my flash drive from [Omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org/).

I then used Balena Etcher to put the ISO onto a flash drive and booted off of it to get to the new OS.

This is very handholdy in its process but I will be learning the major keybind over time and logging my progress here as I learn more things and run into major issues.
